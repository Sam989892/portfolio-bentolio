# IMPLEMENT.md

## üéØ Objective

This document outlines the core implementation plan for developing a responsive, animated, and multi-page portfolio website using custom logic for smooth user experience.

## ‚úÖ Components to Implement

### 1. üìç Navigation Bar

**Location:** Fixed top  
**Items:**

- `Projects`
- `About`
- `Contact`

**Requirements:**

- Use `NavLink` or route-aware logic to highlight the **current active page**.
- Apply a **flip animation** when switching between pages (use `Framer Motion` or CSS `transform: rotateY`).
- Mobile-first responsive hamburger menu for small screens.
- Animation on hover (underline, color change, or slight bounce).

---

### 2. üìÑ Page Routing & Dynamic Component Switching

Each nav item will route to a separate page and swap the main content:

- `/projects` ‚Üí loads `ProjectsSection`
- `/about` ‚Üí loads `AboutSection`
- `/contact` ‚Üí loads `ContactSection`

**Component Load Logic:**

- Apply subtle transition animation when switching components (fade in/out or page flip).
- Maintain global layout (e.g., navbar stays fixed).

---

## üì± Responsiveness

**Strategy:** Mobile-first approach using CSS media queries or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS (recommended).

- Components should stack vertically on small screens.
- Touch-friendly buttons with proper padding and spacing.
- Font sizes and layout scale adaptively with screen size.

---

## ‚ú® Animations (Subtle & Lag-Free)

**Recommended Library:** `Framer Motion` or `GSAP` (for advanced timelines)  
**Implementation Tips:**

- Use `motion.div` wrappers for page transitions.
- Apply spring-based entrance effects on page load.
- Avoid heavy GPU animations like large-scale blur or drop shadows on low-end devices.

**Animation Examples:**

- Nav links gently pop on hover
- Page components fade in with `opacity + scale`
- Contact form fields slide-in when scrolled into view

---

## üß™ Testing

- Test across breakpoints: 360px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop)
- Manually verify smooth transition on nav changes
- Check animation lag on low-end device or throttled network using Chrome DevTools

---

---

## üß† Pro Tips

- Use `localStorage` to remember last visited tab (optional).
- Keep nav buttons sticky on scroll for UX consistency.
- Add slight delay to animation triggers for visual polish.
